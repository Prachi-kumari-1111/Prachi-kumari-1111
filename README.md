Let's Build Innovative Solutions Together! üöÄ

## About Me
I'm a passionate 3rd-year B.Tech CSE student (Batch 2023-2027) with a keen interest in software development and problem-solving. Currently exploring full-stack web development, I love turning ideas into functional applications using modern technologies. Although I'm still building my experience, I've worked on personal projects involving web apps, algorithms, and databases. Eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to open-source!

- üå± Currently learning: Advanced React and SQL for scalable apps.
- üëØ Looking to collaborate on: Web development projects or hackathons.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I started coding in high school and haven't stopped since!
